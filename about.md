**<cy>Colorful Particles</c>** is a very simple mod that allows you to color the player particles you normally wouldn't be able to!

This mod allows you to customize the following particles:

- Ship trailing particles.
- Ship clicking particles.
- Robot jump particles.
- Swing fire particles.

By default, the mod applies your **<cp>P1</c>** and **<cf>P2</c>** colors to the particles, however in the Mod's ***<cg>Settings Page</c>*** you are able to fully *customize* the colors of each particle!
The default coloring for particles is:

- **Ship trailing particles**: Uses *<cp>P1</c>* color.
- **Ship clicking particles**: Uses *<cf>P2</c>* color.
- **Robot jump particles**: Gradients from *<cp>P1</c>* to *<cf>P2</c>* color.
- **Swing fire particles**: Gradients from *<cp>P1</c>* to *<cf>P2</c>* color.

Inside the mod's ***<cg>Settings Page</c>*** you can customize the following aspects:

- <cg>Enable</c>/<cr>Disable</c> each feature of the mod.
- <cd>Swap</c> P1/P2 color tinting for each particle set individually.
- Fully customize <cs>Start/End color & alpha</c> of each particle set individually!

The mod *should* be entirely compatible with other particle mods, as well as with custom particle files loaded via Texture Packs, if you run into any issues, report them on the github page!
