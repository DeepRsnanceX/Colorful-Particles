**Colorful Particles** is a very simple mod that allows you to color the player particles you normally wouldn't be able to!

This mod allows you to customize the following particles:

- Ship trailing particles.
- Ship clicking particles.
- Robot jump particles.
- Swing fire particles.

By default, the mod applies your **P1** and **P2** colors to the particles, however in the Mod's ***Settings Page*** you are able to fully *customize* the colors of each particle!
The default coloring for particles is:

- **Ship trailing particles**: Uses *P1* color.
- **Ship clicking particles**: Uses *P2* color.
- **Robot jump particles**: Gradients from *P1* to *P2* color.
- **Swing fire particles**: Gradients from *P1* to *P2* color.

Inside the mod's ***Settings Page*** you can customize the following aspects:

- Enable/Disable each feature of the mod.
- Swap P1/P2 color tinting for each particle set individually.
- Fully customize Start/End color & alpha of each particle set individually!

The mod *should* be entirely compatible with other particle mods, as well as with custom particle files loaded via Texture Packs, if you run into any issues, report them on the github page!
